# Overwrite-Reddit-Comments
A simple script to quickly overwrite all your reddit comments

It semi-automatize the overwriting of your reddit comments with random numbers. 

Good in case you don't want random bits of public information floating out in the public internet forever.

Reddit keeps all the original comments and edits backed up on their servers though.
